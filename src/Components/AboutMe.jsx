          Greetings Everyone ! As a third-year undergrad in Computer Science
          Engineering, I have developed a solid foundation in programming
          languages like C++ and gained practical experience in frontend
          development. Through my internships, I've had pleasurable experiences
          in building modern and reliable client projects. Being a self
          motivated individual with a growth-oriented mindset I possess a strong
          work ethic, sincere in my efforts and committed to continuous learning
          and improvement. You can now explore this website and feel free to
          leave any comments or feedback, it really means a world to me ! Thank
          you.
